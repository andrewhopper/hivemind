# Validation Report

## Summary
Validation of current architecture against established facts reveals some conflicts that need to be addressed.

## Required Facts
- ✅ Next.js Frontend (arch_nextjs_frontend)
  - Properly implemented with Next.js 15 and App Router
  - Follows required architectural patterns
  
- ✅ Prisma ORM (arch_prisma_orm)
  - Schema and migrations properly configured
  - Type-safe database operations implemented

- ❌ Database Choice (use-postgres)
  - **CONFLICT**: Current implementation uses SQLite, but fact requires PostgreSQL
  - This is a REQUIRED fact and needs immediate attention

## Recommended Facts
- ✅ Documentation (maintain-readme)
  - README.md maintained with required sections
  - Documentation follows markdown format

## Issues
1. Database Implementation Conflict
   - Current: SQLite with Prisma
   - Required: PostgreSQL (per use-postgres fact)
   - Impact: High (REQUIRED fact violation)

## Recommendations
1. Database Migration
   - Plan migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Update Prisma schema to use PostgreSQL provider
   - Ensure all database operations are compatible
   - Create migration scripts for existing data

2. Alternative Approach
   - If SQLite is necessary for specific use cases:
     - Update use-postgres fact to allow SQLite for development/embedded cases
     - Add conditions specifying when each database type should be used
     - Document rationale for database choice flexibility
